#### Lead Data Scientist, Capital One
<small>April 2022 - Present</small>

As Lead Data Scientist at Capital One, I spearheaded the development of a next-best-action engine, which significantly boosted offer acceptance by 18% and generated an impressive $14M in additional revenue. I also drove a $6M uplift in annualized revenue by leading the automation of core marketing data workflows and optimizing campaign infrastructure. A key part of my role involved mentoring and developing data science talent through structured one-on-one sessions and personalized project alignment, which markedly enhanced team engagement and productivity. Furthermore, I was instrumental in improving model accuracy by 15% for a critical $100M lead generation product by identifying and incorporating additional data sources and modernizing the model rebuild with an advanced XGBoost algorithm.

#### Manager, Data Science - Group 1 Automotive
<small>July 2021 - April 2022</small>

During my tenure as Manager of Data Science at Group 1 Automotive, I successfully increased targeted campaign response rates by 10% and significantly modernized marketing operations through the implementation of an advanced analytics stack, notably including Snowflake. My work also fueled a 14% increase in post-sale attach rates for high-margin finance products within the first 30 days by accurately identifying high-propensity customer segments using sophisticated analytics. I played a pivotal role in scaling the data science function, collaborating effectively across departments to deliver actionable insights that directly informed and shaped product, marketing, and customer strategies.

#### Data Scientist - Daikin North America
<small>December 2017 - July 2021</small>

At Daikin North America, I developed comprehensive Marketing Mix Models (MMM) and multi-touch attribution models to optimize new omni-channel marketing strategies, achieving a 12% increase in Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). I also greatly improved team efficiency by 125% and broadened report adoption across business units by automating 15 high-impact recurring reports using Tableau. A significant achievement was the creation and deployment of a customer propensity model that improved 60-day retention by an outstanding 150%, generating $8M in incremental revenue for a newly launched e-commerce platform. Additionally, I was responsible for increasing customer retention by 6% and preserving $60M in revenue by automating multi-source Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis using Alteryx, integrating data from 16 disparate datasets.
