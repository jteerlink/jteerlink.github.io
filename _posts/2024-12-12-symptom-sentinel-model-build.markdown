# Symptom Sentinel Model

This repository supports the **SymptomSentinelAI** application by providing trained models to detect **ear** and **throat infections** from medical images. It serves as a learning platform for medical image classification using deep learning techniques.

#### <strong>[Github Repository](https://github.com/jteerlink/symptom-sentinel-model)</strong>

## Repository Structure

- `ear_dataset/`: Contains labeled images for ear infection diagnosis.
- `throat_dataset/`: Contains labeled images for throat infection detection.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks covering preprocessing, model training, and evaluation workflows.
- `setup/`: Scripts and configuration files to set up the training and deployment environment.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to build and validate a machine learning model capable of classifying images of the ear and throat into healthy or infected categories. It contributes to the broader mission of integrating AI into healthcare diagnostics, particularly for use in consumer-facing mobile applications.

## Getting Started

To replicate or extend this project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jteerlink/symptom-sentinel-model.git
2.	**Set Up the Environment**:
	•	Navigate to the setup/ folder.
	•	Follow the instructions to install dependencies and configure the environment.
3.	**Explore the Notebooks**:
	•	Open the .ipynb files in notebooks/ to view and run preprocessing, training, and evaluation code.
4.	**Train the Model**:
	•	Use the datasets provided to train a classification model.
	•	Experiment with parameters to optimize performance.

## Future Enhancements
	•	Data Augmentation: Increase robustness by simulating more clinical scenarios.
	•	Model Optimization: Explore different CNN architectures and hyperparameters.
	•	Deployment: Package the final model for integration into mobile or web-based diagnostic applications.
